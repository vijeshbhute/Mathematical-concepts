# Mathematics and Data-Science
**About me**
- I have been coding since 2008, started with formally learning to code in **Java** (received an A at a premiere Institute in India). Completed several projects with **C++** and **MATLAB** and did a research project using **FORTRAN**! All of this during my undergraduate degree. It is true that once you understand one programming language, it is relatively easy to learn a new one. I wrote 1000s of lines of codes and ran simulations on clusters and adapted simulations to perform parallel computing. 
- During my undergraduate, I published algorithms to predict the accuracy of Markov chain models with applications in Molecular simulations using kinetic Monte Carlo. 
- I moved to one of the best places to study in the USA, *Madison, WI*. I took a course on Optimisation where I used **GAMS** and solved famous problems including *Travelling salesman, solving Sudoko, etc.* using *mixed integer linear programming (MILP)*. I also took another course on Biostatistics and wrote several codes to perform *Hierarchical clustering using different distance measures, BLAST (one of the most popular algorithms for searching DNA sequences), etc.* using **C++**. I remember it being very rewarding to write codes from scratch. But programming was going to change with the emergence of libraries in **Python** and **R**!
- My PhD research involved conducting experiments on cancer cells and analysing *metabolomics* data. I used **MATLAB** to automate several data preprocessing steps. I also made beating heart cells in a dish which was extremely cool! This was the time when I started using R and applied dimensionality reduction techniques including *Principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)*, *Hierarchical clustering*, *Pathway enrichment analyses*, and several other *chemiinformatic* and *statistical methods such as one way analysis of variance (one way-ANOVA)*. I collaborated extensively and conducted research in metabolism, stem cells, stroke, age-related macular degeneration and also won the *WARF Discovery Challenge Grant*!
- I continued using **R** during my post-doctoral research, this time to analyse transcriptomic datasets consisting of information from 20,000 genes! I analysed and visualised the data and developed and tested hypotheses! I also learned to work with mice and made some amazing discoveries!
- Nowadays, I routinely use **Jupyter Notebooks (Python)** to develop visualisations to aid in teaching complex and abstract mathematical concepts. I enjoy working with students and help them in their coding journey. I have managed several projects which involved coding in **Wolfram Alpha (Wolfram Notebooks)**, **Perl**, **LaTeX**, **HTML**, and **Maple**.  

**Content description**
This repository will aim to include my projects where I have used interesting visualisations to explain abstract concepts to undergraduate students as part of my instruction of Mathematics Fundamentals and Engineering Mathematics courses. I will also include some advanced analysis using fipy to solve partial differential equations.
